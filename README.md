# DDLC-MonikaInKernel

## About this project

Monika is the most special girl in DDLC, who can control the Renâ€™Py fundamental engine, which is the core of this game world. She wants the player to spend most time with her, otherwise she will be suffering from random data noise when her virtual memory released by system. However, this Mod will give her a chance to upgrading into Ring0 (in Windows), and Non-Paged Kernel memory can be granted to her. What will she do after this upgrading when she got the highest system privilege?

I've major build this project within VS2022, so better to install vcruntime to avoid some runtime error.

Differently from any type of Virus or Rootkit, this Mod is NOT designed for us to control your computer.
